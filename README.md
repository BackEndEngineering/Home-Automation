The problem occurs when your forgetting the items in the store
and the checklist is not updated while wondering if you need to buy more water bottles.
Better yet, your spouse calls you while your in long line
at the grocery store to tell she already got the groceries.
What about waking up late and rushing to work and forget to feed your dog in the morning.
Lets say you have a hot date coming over for dinner at the last minute and you don't have
time to rush to grocery store and you don't know what to make with the ingredients you
already have for a nice cook meal.
