## Elevator pitch

Dealing with the data bridge between the web interface and the core application
the Raspberry Pi finds it way to internet of things.
As the Raspberry Pi finds its way onto more and more workbenches,
new opportunities arise not only to transfer data from electronic projects
to a local network or the Internet but also to provide options for feedback and control.
A web GUI system app is a plus to access Raspberry Pi's GPIO remotely. To control their
operation remotely once the Raspberry is setup.
